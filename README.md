# MappingsUpdater
An upcoming mappings updater that is work in progress currently.


This updater allows it to update Spigot NMS mappings using transition mappings.
Transition mappings are mappings generated by getting the obfuscated names of two targeted versions.

```
obf_name_1.15.2 <-> clear_name_1.15.2 <-> clear_name_20w16a <-> obf_name_20w16a
```

In the end we have the transition mappings.
```access transformers
obf_name_1.15.2 <-> obf_name_20w16a
```

Now we can easily load Spigot mappings for 1.15.2

```access transformers
spigot_mappings_1.15.2 <-> obf_name_1.15.2 <-> obf_name_20w16a <-> spigot_mappings_20w16a
```
